            <p> It is very simple to understand and easy to implement
                - Supervised Algorithm   </p>
            <p>   - It solves both types of problems - classification and regression
                - non paramatic and lazy algorithm   </p>
            <p class="e">  - non paramatic means it is independent upon underlying data distribution ie it is not depend upon
                on model structure of dataset   </p>
            <p>   - lazy algorithm means it uses trained dataset not during model building but during determination
                or predication   </p>
            <p>  - It is suitable for small/medium of dataset [ ie not suitable for large dataset ] [Takes time for   predication]</p>
